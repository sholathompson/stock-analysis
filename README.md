# Overview of Project 
## Background of Project
Our client, Steve is supporting his parents with investing their money into Green Energy options. Steve’s parents are intent on “investing all their money into DAQO” a new energy corporation that specializes in creating Silicon wafers for solar panels. Our client expressed that he would like to diversify his parent’s portfolio to include other forms of green energy and would like analysis on other forms of bioenergy to include hydroelectricity, wind energy, thermal energy and bioenergy. Client has provided an excel document with data for DAQO as well as 11 other green energy corporations to analyze.

## Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze DAQO as well as a portfolio of 11 other green energy investment options. Analysis will focus on the total number of shares traded throughout the day (i.e. total daily volume) as well as the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year (i.e. yearly return) for each stock. 
Of specific note, Steve may want to look at a different set of stocks in the future and has requested that the analysis include an easy to use, flexible macro for running multiple stocks. 

## Deliverables 
- DAQO 
  - Daily Volume
  - Yearly Return
- All Green Energy Stocks (N =12)
  - Daily Volume
  - Yearly Return 
  - Automated buttons that will run the macro automatically for any year identified. 
- In preparation for a larger data set analysis, Steve would like to know how fast his VBA code will compile the results. Therefore we will add a script that will calculate how long the code takes to execute and output the elapsed time in a message box

# Results 

![Table 1- DAQO Daily Volume and Yearly Return.png](
As Table 1, illustrates, DAQO yearly return dropped 63% indicating that this is a risky investment for his parents at this time.
